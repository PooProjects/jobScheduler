# jobScheduler
This is a job scheduler in java. It schedules the job based on the time .
Client sends the job to the server to be schedule at specific time. So the job has a timestamp.
The Scheduler then schedules the job. It is a per day job scheduler. So if the client sends a Job with 12pm timestamp and 12pm is in past then that job will not be schedule .
